# React Router Usage & Upgrade Guide

## Current Usage Status
- Uses `react-router-dom` version 6.30.1 (up to date as of 2024-06).
- All imports and routing (`BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, and `NavLink as RRNavLink`) follow React Router v6+ practices.
- No deprecated APIs (`Switch`, `Redirect`, `useHistory`, etc.) detected in the codebase.

## Recommended Actions
- **No migration required:** Your code adheres to the latest stable React Router conventions.
- **Monitor updates:** Periodically check the [React Router release notes](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview) for new guidance or breaking changes.
- **When adding routes:** Continue using `<Routes>`, `<Route>`, and `useNavigate` for navigation.
- **If dependencies change:** After updating dependencies, test navigation and check for any new deprecation warnings.

## Good Practices
- Prefer `element={<Component />}` style with `<Route>` (v6+).
- Import navigation hooks as needed: `useNavigate`, `useParams`, etc.
- For navigation links, continue using `NavLink as RRNavLink` or the v6 `Link` component.
