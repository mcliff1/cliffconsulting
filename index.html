    About This Site
    </div>

    <p>
    This site is running serverless on AWS cloud.  It is currently static content, using the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">bootstrap</a> framework built on jQuery. The articles and projects are published here, as well as on RPub, Shiny and GitHub.  I am currently working with the <a href="http://serverless.com">Serverless Framework</a> and various Docker containers for presenting R and Python work, however free options such as GitHub and Kaggle are also great places to share data work. Docker continues to amaze me as a part of a development toolkit,
    I just located the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/openbridge/ob_pysh-db/">pysh-db</a> image which is a swiss-army knife of command line interface to any common Remote DB all for 400MB.
